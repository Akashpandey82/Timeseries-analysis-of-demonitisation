FOR CASH DATA
CODE
//////////////////////////////////
df = read.delim("cashdata1.txt", header = F, sep = "\t", dec = ".")  # reading data as text file
dftimeseries = ts(df[[1]],frequency = 12,start=c(2016,7))          # converting data into text file
library(tseries)                               
adf.test(dftimeseries)
///////////////////////////////////////////////
RESULT
////////////////////

Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test

data:  dftimeseries
Dickey-Fuller = -3.729, Lag order = 3, p-value = 0.03482
alternative hypothesis: stationary
///////////////////
AS p value is less than 0.05 our data is stationary for the cash data

Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test

data:  dftimeseries
Dickey-Fuller = -3.3312, Lag order = 3, p-value = 0.08326
alternative hypothesis: stationary
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
p value greeater than 0.05
our data is not stationary





///////////////////
so we have to make stationary for online transaction data
